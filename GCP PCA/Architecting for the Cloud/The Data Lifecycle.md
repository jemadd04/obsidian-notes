Four primary steps in the data lifecycle:
- Ingest: pull in raw data via streaming, batch, or app processes
- Store: keep the retrieved data in a durable and accessible environment
- Process/analyze: transform the data into actionable information
- Explore/visualize: convert processed data into shareable, relatable content

## Data ingestion

### Streaming

Brings in data as quickly as possible in near real-time
GCP Solution: Cloud Pub/Sub
Pub/Sub publishes data to make it available and the subscriber ingests

### Batch

Opposite of streaming
When data is stored in a stable location, you can choose how much data (how big a batch) you want to process
GCP Solutions:
- Cloud Storage (most basic)
	- Can handle any kind of binary object in any format
	- Great for holding onto data until you are ready to access
- Storage Transfer Service
	- For when you have a lot of on-prem data that you want to bring into Cloud Storage
	- Can also be used to move data from one storage bucket to another
- BigQuery Transfer Service
	- For when you are handling data from SaaS apps and want to move structured data
- Storage Transfer Appliance
	- High capacity storage device that allows you to store and ship to a Google facility
	- Can move petabytes of data

### Application

Data that is forwarded or generated by an application
GCP Solutions:
- Cloud Logging
	- Outputs user logs, system logs, and audit logs
- Cloud Pub/Sub
	- Can be an app source due to basic messaging capabilities
- Cloud SQL
	- Structured data
- Cloud Firestore
	- Serverless document database for working with NoSQL data
- Cloud Bigtable
	- When working with large amounts of SQL data
	- Can act as a storage engine for ML apps
- Cloud Spanner
	- For huge amounts of structured data
	- Unlimited scalability
	- Global

## Data Storage

### Objects

Cloud Storage is ideal for storing blobs and data objects
Another option is Cloud Storage for Firebase
- Firebase is Google's platform for creating mobile and web applications
- Some overlap

### Databases

- Cloud SQL
	- Relational DB solution for MySQL, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL
- Cloud Spanner
	- Massive structured data
- Cloud Bigtable
	- Massive NoSQL solution
- Cloud Firestore
	- Next gen of Cloud Datastore

### Warehouse

Google has one service: BigQuery
- Serverless and highly scalable data warehouse
- If migrating from another warehouse, you'll want to migrate to BigQuery

## Data Processing

### Compute

- Compute Engine
	- VMs are the servers doing the actual work for many other GCP services
	- Most configurable
- Kubernetes Engine
	- GKE
	- Containers
	- Heavy focus on the PCA
- App Engine
	- Gets apps up and running quickly

### Large-Scale

- Cloud Dataproc
	- Data lake modernization, ETL, and secure data science
	- Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, etc.
	- Built to allow you to use preexisting tools with cloud power and ease
- Cloud Dataflow
	- Apache Beam
	- Data pipelines
- Cloud Dataprep
	- Intelligent cloud data service to visually explore, clean, and prepare data for analysis and ML

### Analyzing

- Bigquery
	- Used by a lot of large companies
	- Petabytes of data at incredible speeds w/ little to no overhead


## Data Exploration


### Science

- Cloud Datalab
	- Uses Jupyter notebooks
	- Access, analyze, monitor, and visualize data with Python, SQL, and Tensorflow

### Visualizing

- BigQuery BI
	- Business intelligence tool
- Cloud Data Studio
	- Can be utilized by a host of GCP services to visualize data dynamically
- Looker
	- Front end enterprise platform for business intelligence and analytics


## Summary

- Four phases of data lifecycle: ingest, store, process/analyze, explore/visualize
- Data is ingested via streaming, batching, and app processes
- Data structure can change, depending on its source and destination
- Google offers a wide array of services
