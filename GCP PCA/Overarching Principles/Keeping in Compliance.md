### Compliance with What?
Four basic categories concerned with compliance:
- Legislation - targeted areas include health regulations, privacy, children's privacy, and ownership
- Commercial - need to protect sensitive data, such as credit card details and personally identifiable info (PII)
- Industry Certifications - companies need to make sure they are following health, safety, and environmental regulations
- Audits - create the necessary structure to allow for third-party audits
